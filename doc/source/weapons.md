## Swords

### Kaiken

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiken_(dagger)

> A kaiken (懐剣) is a 20–25 cm (7.9–9.8 in) long, single or (very rarely) double-edged Japanese knife[1] usually without ornamental fittings housed in a plain but lacquered mount.

> The kaiken was also carried concealed in its shirasaya by the lower classes who were not permitted to wear swords, in particular by criminals in the Edo period.

### Katana

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana

> A katana (刀, かたな) is a Japanese sword characterized by a curved, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard and long grip to accommodate two hands.

> The katana is generally defined as the standard sized, moderately curved (as opposed to the older tachi featuring more curvature) Japanese sword with a blade length greater than 60.6 cm (23.86 inches) (over 2 shaku).[13] It is characterized by its distinctive appearance: a curved, slender, single-edged blade with a circular or squared guard (tsuba) and long grip to accommodate two hands.[13]

> The katana further facilitated this by being worn thrust through a belt-like sash (obi) with the sharpened edge facing up. Ideally, samurai could draw the sword and strike the enemy in a single motion. Previously, the curved tachi had been worn with the edge of the blade facing down and suspended from a belt.[13][29]

### Kodachi

> A kodachi (小太刀, こだち), literally translating into "small or short tachi (sword)", is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords (nihontō) used by the samurai class of feudal Japan.
> They are often confused with wakizashi, due to their length and handling techniques. However, their construction is what sets the two apart, as kodachi are a set length while wakizashi are forged to complement the wielder's height or the length of their katana.[2]

### Naginata

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naginata

> A naginata consists of a wooden or metal pole with a curved single-edged blade on the end; it is similar to the Chinese guan dao[4] or the European glaive.[5] Similar to the katana, naginata often have a round handguard (tsuba) between the blade and shaft, when mounted in a koshirae (furniture). The 30 cm to 60 cm (11.8 inches to 23.6 inches) naginata blade is forged in the same manner as traditional Japanese swords. The blade has a long tang (nakago) which is inserted in the shaft.

> The naginata was appreciated because it was a weapon that could maintain an optimum distance from the enemy in close combat.


### Nagamaki

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagamaki

> It is possible that nagamaki were first produced during the Heian period (794 to 1185) but there are no known examples dating from before the mid Kamakura period (1192–1333).[4] The nagamaki is believed to have been developed from the ōdachi (great sword).

> Wielding is very specific; it is held with two hands in a fixed position in the same way a katana is held. Unlike the naginata, the hands do not change when handling the weapon and the right hand was always the closest to the blade. While handling nagamaki fewer sliding actions on the handle are performed than are with the naginata, where the entire length of the shaft is used. The nagamaki is designed for large sweeping and slicing strokes.[12] Traditionally the nagamaki was used as an infantry weapon, frequently used against cavalry.

### Ōdachi / Nodachi

> The ōdachi (大太刀) (large/great sword) or nodachi (野太刀, field sword)[4][5][6] is a type of traditionally made Japanese sword (日本刀, nihontō)[7][8] used by the samurai class of feudal Japan.

> To qualify as an ōdachi, the sword in question would have a blade length of around 3 shaku (90.9 cm (35.8 in)). However, as with most terms in Japanese sword arts, there is no exact definition of the size of an ōdachi.

> Ōdachi became popular in Kamakura period (1185－1333). Until the middle of the Kamakura period, high-ranking samurai mainly fought on horseback with yumi (bows), but as group battles by foot soldiers increased from the late Kamakura period, the importance of weapons possessed by those who did not have horses and did not have sufficient training in bows increased. Until then, they mainly used naginata with a long handle, but they also started to use ōdachi. The Kamakura period was the first time that samurai ruled Japan, and powerful men were valued, and those who wanted to show off the honor of being a warrior preferred to use ōdachi.

> An exception does exist, though. The Kōden Enshin-ryū taught by Fumon Tanaka use a special drawing technique for "short" ōdachi allowing it to be carried on the waist. The technique is to pull out the sheath rather than drawing the blade. While this move is also used in other schools, for example, Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Shin musō Hayashizaki-ryū and Iaidō, only Enshin-ryū seems to have used it to improve the drawing speed of an ōdachi, the other schools having used it with classical katana. The Kage-ryū style is also used to draw from the belt, using blades of approximately 2.8 shaku (84.9 cm (33.4 in).

> Ōdachi swordplay styles differed from that of other Japanese swords, focusing on downward cuts.

### Tantō

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tant%C5%8D

> A tantō (短刀, 'short blade')[1] is a traditionally made Japanese knife[2] (nihontō)[3][4] that were worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan.

> Tantō were mostly carried by samurai; commoners did not generally wear them. Women sometimes carried a small tantō called a kaiken[6] in their obi, primarily for self-defense. Tantō were sometimes worn as the shōtō (小刀) in place of a wakizashi in a daishō,[7][8] especially on the battlefield. Before the advent of the wakizashi/tantō combination, it was common for a samurai to carry a tachi and a tantō as opposed to a katana and a wakizashi.[7]

### Tachi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachi

> A tachi (太刀) is a type of sabre-like traditionally made Japanese sword (nihonto) worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan ... Tachi were the mainstream Japanese swords of the Kotō period between 900 and 1596.[2] Even after the Muromachi period (1336–1573), when katana became the mainstream, tachi were often worn by high-ranking samurai.

### Wakizashi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakizashi

> The wakizashi (Japanese: 脇差, "side inserted [sword]"[1]) is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords (nihontō)[2][3] worn by the samurai in feudal Japan.

> Wakizashi have been in use as far back as the 15th[6] or 16th century.[7] The wakizashi was used as a backup or auxiliary sword;[1] it was also used for close quarters fighting, to behead a defeated opponent[8] and sometimes to commit seppuku.[9] The wakizashi was one of several short swords available for use by samurai including the yoroi tōshi, and the chisa-katana. The term wakizashi did not originally specify swords of any official blade length[10] and was an abbreviation of wakizashi no katana ("sword thrust at one's side"); the term was applied to companion swords of all sizes.[11]

> Kanzan Satō, in his book titled The Japanese Sword, notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the wakizashi and suggests that the wakizashi may have become more popular than the tantō because it was more suited for indoor fighting. He mentions the custom of leaving the katana at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the wakizashi inside.[20]

### Yoroi-dōshi

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoroi-d%C5%8Dshi

> The yoroi-dōshi (鎧通し), "armor piercer"[1][2] or "mail piercer",[3] is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords (nihontō) that were worn by the samurai class as a weapon in feudal Japan.

> The yoroi-dōshi was made for piercing armour[5] and for stabbing while grappling in close quarters. The blade was generally from 20 to 30 cm (7.9 to 11.8 in) in length, but some examples could be shorter than 15 cm (5.9 in), with a "tapering mihaba, iori-mune, thick kasane at the top, and thin kasane at the bottom and occasionally moroha-zukuri construction".[4] The motogasane (blade thickness) at the munemachi (the notch at the beginning of the back edge of the blade) can be up to 1 cm (0.39 in) thick, which is characteristic of the yoroi-dōshi. The extra thickness at the spine of the blade distinguishes the yoroi-dōshi from a standard tantō blade.

> Yoroi-dōshi were worn inside the belt on the back or on the right side[1] with the hilt toward the front and the edge upward. Due to being worn on the right, the blade would have been drawn using the left hand, giving rise to the alternate name of metezashi (馬手差),[6] or "horse-hand (i.e. rein-hand, i.e. left-hand) blade".

## Polearms

### Yari

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yari

> Yari (槍) is the term for a traditionally-made Japanese blade (日本刀; nihontō)[2][3] in the form of a spear, or more specifically, the straight-headed spear.[4] The martial art of wielding the yari is called sōjutsu.

> Yari were characterized by a straight blade that could be anywhere from several centimeters to 3 feet (0.91 m) or more in length.[4] The blades were made of the same steel (tamahagane) from which traditional Japanese swords and arrowheads were forged, and were very durable.[4]
