## Summary

A two-player dueling game where players first plan and prepare their strategy and counter-strategies simultaneously in nearly-full view of one another. This is followed by a final duel, where the choices they made initially will bear fruit, or not, depending on how they choose to utilize them.

Playable in 15-30 minutes. 2 Players. ages 12+ (probably?)

> Shin Ken => "True Sword"

## Objective

Defeat your opponent in a final dueling round, after four initial rounds of collaborative preparation.

### Card features

#### Venue

When a card is pulled at the beginning of the game to be used as a venue card, only the "venue" portion of the card is shown. Each venue card will define something about the dueling venue.

#### Training

The "Training" portion features a title (typically a quote pulled from _Go Rin No Sho_), and some sort of function that it performs. These effects occur when the card is selected from the training pool.

#### Duel

The "Duel" portion describes what the card's function is when it is used during the final "Duel" phase of the game. Generally speaking these cards take effect while in the DUEL SPREAD.

##### Weapon

> Should it presumed the players always have a sword but may also have a side-weapon, and that's what this card is?

##### Technique (TBR)

This is a card describing a specific kind of offensive technique or attack, modifying how attacks normally work.

- A player may have multiple techniques revealed at once.
- A technique must be faceup in a DUEL SPREAD to be active.

##### Stance (TBR)

This describes a style, defensive technique, posture, or stance that persists in play once revealed. 

- A player may have multiple facedown stances in their duel spread.
- A player may only have one faceup stance in their duel spread.
- If a player ever has more than one stance faceup, they must choose one to keep faceup and turn the others facedown before continuing.

##### Action

This is a one-off attempt, gambit, or tactic that is discarded after use. 

- A player may only play actions on their turn, as the aggressor
- After an action is performed, the card is discarded to the player's reserves.

##### Reaction

This is an action that responds, counters, or reacts to a specific triggering event. They can provide the element of surprise, either as a table-turning countermeasure or perhaps as a last-ditch rescue effort.

- A player may play a reaction anytime that the triggering event occurs.
- After a reaction is performed, the card is discarded to the player's reserves.

## Ground rules

### Specificity supremacy

When the text of a card contradicts a rule of the game, the card's text supersedes the game rule.

### Tie-breakers

When tie-breakers among cards are needed, use their element. 

| Highest |  | | | Lowest |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |  -- |
| üï≥Ô∏è | üí® | üî• | üíß | üå≤ |
| void | air | fire | water | earth |

If there is still a tie, the aggressor or active player takes precedence.

### "Faceup" vs "Facedown"

A card is "facedown" when its "type" (the elemental symbol) is showing. It is "faceup" when the text is showing. 

Facedown cards in common spaces (not possessed by either player) may not be revealed until the rules, or a card effect, allows this to happen. 

Facedown cards possessed by a player may be privately viewed by the possessor at anytime, or by their opponent if the rules, or a card effect, allows this to happen.

## Setup

```

    [üÇ†]  < The Player's RESERVE

    [üí®] [üí®] [üî•] [üíß] [üíß]   < The Opponent's DUEL SPREAD
üï≥Ô∏è
üí®
üî•   -=[                      ]=- <  Dueling Ground
üíß                                   The vertical cards to
üå≤                                   the left are ENVIRONMENT

    [üå≤] [üï≥Ô∏è] [üî•] [üî•] [üï≥Ô∏è]   < The Player's DUEL SPREAD

    [üÇ†] < The Player's RESERVE (single stack, facedown)

```

Each player has a Duel Spread that will eventually contain 5 cards. These cards are faceup to the player, but facedown to the opponent. 

The opponent may always know how many cards, and of which element, are in their opponent's duel spread.

Each player has a reserve. The reserve *pile* must be *visible* to the opponent, but the player may arrange the cards however they like to obscure the *contents*, including its size.

### Board setup

Before any cards are dealt:

1. With care to not reveal which cards are chosen, randomly remove 2 cards of each element.
2. From these cards, arrange 1 card of each element, face down, in a row alongside the  playing area. This will define the duel venue.
3. Return the remaining 5 of those cards (1 of each element) to the box (it will not be used this game)
4. Shuffle the remaining 40 cards together.

### Player setup

Deal the remaining cards into facedown stacks of 5 cards. It's OK if each stack has a varied composition of elements. 

Each player gets 4 stacks (these can be distributed by whatever means players agree on). Players should not look at the contents of these stacks yet.

Each pair of stacks represent one game round of training and preparation.

### Phase I: Training

Training consists of 4 rounds. Through these 4 rounds, the players will assemble their final dueling hand of 5 cards. A round represents a training period moving each player incrementally towards mastery.

Each training round, the first player is determined by these rules (follow top to bottom until one ties are broken):

- which player has fewer cards chosen for their duel spread
- which card types are present in their duel spread (see tie-breaker rules above)
- which player has more cards in reserve
- which player is younger (down to the second, if needed)
- actual sword fight, IRL

#### Game loop

> Reminder: The Duel spread can contain a maximum of 5 cards, all facedown.

While each player's reserve pile must be visible (as a unit), they may shuffle or re-order the cards at any time, to obscure past choices, particularly when moving from reserve to duel spread.

As cards are selected from the TRAINING POOL, players are encouraged to read the TRAINING title of the card aloud.

0. At the beginning of the round, reveal the lowest ranked (see tie-breakers) DUEL VENUE card by flipping it to faceup.
1. Each player chooses one of their stacks to use this round
2. Each player may *optionally* choose one card to put directly into their DUEL SPREAD, facedown.
3. The remaining cards in each players' hands are revealed faceup into a common area between the players, this is the TRAINING POOL.
4. Determine turn order (above)
5. Each player performs one of the following and then passes to the next player
  - choose one card from the training pool, perform its TRAINING action, and then add it to their reserves, facedown.
  - choose one card from their reserves to add to their duel spread, facedown
6. This Training Day ends immediately when the TRAINING POOL is empty.

Repeat this process for each Training Day, until all stacks have been used.

> Reminder: once a card has been added to the DUEL SPREAD, it is committed and may not be removed during TRAINING unless otherwise allowed by a card effect.

#### Phase end

At the end of the final training round, players may look through their reserves and add, but not exchange any missing cards to their Duel spread.

### Phase II: Duel

At the beginning of the Duel, the final Duel Venue card (üï≥ Void) is revealed. Players should review and briefly discuss any rules prescribed by the DUEL VENUE cards.

> Reminder: **REACTIONs** can be played any time their conditions are met. 
> Reminder: **TECHNIQUEs** can be revealed at any time.

When a card is discarded from the DUEL SPREAD, it goes to the RESERVES. 

When a card is discarded from the RESERVES it is removed from play.

#### 0. Koiguchi san sun (Initiating)

To begin, players must first determine who is the initiator (first aggressor).

##### Formal

Both players count their reserves and announce the total. The person who has more cards in their **reserve** is the initiator.

##### Informal

> In single combat, we make as if to cut and shout "Ei!" at the same time to disturb the enemy, then in the wake of our shout we cut with the long sword. ("The Three Shouts", Book of Fire)

At *any point* until an initiator is selected, either player may choose to shout "EI!" (like "eye" but curt and forceful), "draw" a weapon (flip faceup) in their duel spread; they are the initiator.

**The player must *actually* shout, with sincere vigor, to claim this.**

Their opponent may also freely reveal one from their DUEL SPREAD (shouting in response is allowed, but does not change who is initiator).

##### Beginning

With the initator determined, the duel begins.

#### 1. Aggressor

The aggressor must choose to either ENGAGE or WAIT.

##### Engage

Choose 1:

- **Attack unarmed**. This attack has no element (the opponent can always PARRY or RIPOSTE it with any card)
- **Attack with a WEAPON that is already DRAWN (faceup)**. The element of the attack is the element of the weapon card.
- **Perform an ACTION**. Reveal the action from your duel spread, perform it, then discard it to your reserves.

The opponent most now **respond** (Step 2).

##### Wait

Choose 1:

- **SHEATHE a WEAPON**: Flip one of your weapons facedown in the duel spread.
- **DRAW a WEAPON**: Flip a WEAPON in your duel spread faceup. If the drawn WEAPON is a two-handed (2H) weapon, turn your other WEAPONs facedown.
- **take a STANCE**: Flip all of your STANCEs facedown, flip one STANCE faceup.
- **STUDY**: Name an element, your opponent must tell you how many of that element they have.

The opponent becomes the **aggressor** (Step 1)

#### 2. Responder

The responder must defend, evade, or yield. 

After responding, the aggressor begins again.

> Reminder: If an effect allows you a RIPOSTE, this is considered an immediate attack that the opponent must RESPOND to, but you **do not** automatically become the aggressor, however it does terminate the current attack.

##### DEFEND 

Defending negates the attack without ceding ground by steeling your spirit.

All DEFEND actions involve discarding cards from your reserves.

###### with PARRY

A parry artfully defends and captures momentum, turning the attack back on the attacker.

Choose one:

- Discard 1 reserve card of a higher element than the attack
- Discard 2 reserve cards of the same element as the attack.

You become the aggressor.

###### with BLOCK

A block successfully negates an attack, at a small loss of momentum.

Choose one:

- SHEATHE (flip facedown) a drawn WEAPON
- Flip a STANCE facedown

Opponent remains the aggressor.

##### EVADE

Evasion successfully avoids harm, but at a more significant cost. 

Your opponent remains the aggressor.

###### with DODGE

Dodging allows you to move out of the path of the attack by yielding ground.

Choose one:

- Discard 1 reserve card of the same element as the attack. 
- Discard any 2 reserve cards.

###### with DIVE

Diving safely avoids an attack but at a loss of balance.

Choose one:

- Discard any duel spread card (faceup or facedown)
- Discard all _reserve cards_ of the lowest element in your reserves, minimum 1.

##### Yield (Lose)

> "We shout \[EI!\] after we have cut down the enemy - this is to announce victory. This is called "sen go no koe" (before and after voice)." ("The Three Shouts", Book of Fire)

The duel ends, opponent wins.
