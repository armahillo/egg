## Thematic Metaphors in SHINKEN 

### 3.1.1 What is the central thematic metaphor?

The players are feudal era samurai preparing, and then doing, a duel.

The metaphor is reinforced by these core qualities:

- It is two players only ("duel")
- There is a planning / training period followed by the duel itself. This leans on the historical quality of samurai having a lifelong training in bushido. 
- The duel is meant to be the decisive adjudicator of strategy, and will likely end quickly
- The majority of the game emphasizes the planning, preparation and development of that strategy

### 3.1.2 How would the game change if the metaphor changed?

It might feel more like a conventional "open conflict" game, or perhaps a duel that it set in a different setting. The balance between the training and duel phases is meant to underscore the feeling of mastery, and the fleeting nature of the duel is meant to emphasize the deadliness.

### 3.2 Create a design vision statement that is based on the central metaphor of the theme

"I want players to experience the mastery and deadliness of bushido through a simulation of a feudal-japan-era duel"
