# Assumptions

- Within each book type, one card can be selected, therefore when a card is selected, all other cards from that book type cannot be selected.
- Within each card, if a card effect is used for environment, it is not used as a training effect or duel card.
- Some effects may allow those two assumptions to be challenged
- The opportunity cost of keeping a card in reserve is that you cannot use it in your duel, so higher ranked cards can have more powerful effects

- Each player should probably always have a single katana available to them as a primary weapon. The other WEAPON cards in-game should be used as secondary weapons.
