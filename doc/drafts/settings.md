---

Training phase is the same.

Dueling phase is different.

The five cards are played facedown in a cross pattern, representing the five stances (upper, lower, left, right, middle). 

The remaining cards are in reserve facedown. A player can look at their own reserve cards, but only know the elements of their opponent's reserve.

When a player plays a card from their reserves, it is played to one of the guard positions, then its effect is performed. The card that is replaced is returned to the reserves (if played offensively) or discarded (if played defensively).

A player may rearrange the cards in their stance, including adding cards directly from reserves to positions that are empty.

Cards that are played offensively may require certain configurations of elements in the stances, to be played.

A regular attack can be made from one particular position, using the element of that position.
